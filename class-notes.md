Parcel :

npm install package-name -> to install a package named package-name  & node modules (helper functions )is created 

npm install -d package-name -> -D means dev dependency or --save-dev

package-lock.json is created and parcel code is updated in node modules

parcel is in dev dependencies of package-lock - parcel is needed in dev environment

if update happens, package.json is updated but package-lock.json is not updated

package-lock.json - dont ignore in git but put node modules in .gitignore

if we have package-lock.json -> we can regenerate node modules

react cdn - is not a good way Good way -> in server thrugh node modules

npm install react -> in global dependencies not dev dependencies

npx parcel index.html -> Execute using npm with index.html as entry point -> Creates local server

Parcel gives us this server

Error : React is defined because we removed cdn link. Instead of that, we have to use import since this time we are using node modules - npm

Error : Browser doesnot understand import -> we have to inform its modules, use type="module" in script tag

Warning : React DOM -> createRoot is not found -> use react-dom/client

Live Server -> Auto refresh -> Hot Module Replacement (HMR) -> Parcel does it for us using File Watcher Algorithm (written in c++) Parcel.cache -> uses this space for doing all the HMR, minify and other stuffs dist folder -> minified code in dist npx parcel build index.html -> production ready build is created by parcel inside dist folder and has only 3 files : css, html and js file containing all the code including react code

Parcel Functionalities :

minification (removing indentation),
image optimizations,
compression(renaming variables),
cleaning our code,
super fast build,
dev and prod builds,
caching while development
works with older version of browsers
Https on dev as well npx parcel index.html --https 10.Consistent Hashing Algorithm 11.zero config
Tree shaking - Removing unwanted code
we should put .parcel-cache in gitignore -> anything which can be autogenerated in server can be put in gitignore

Initial dev build -> longer time (500ms) -> for next build -> takes less time 5ms using caching

When using parcel, we give entry point in command so we can remove main: app.js from package.json

Transitive dependencies -> dependencies of dependencies Eg: Our App is dependent on Parcel which is again dependent on other dependencies (dependency Tree)

browsersList -> cross browser compatibility for older versions of browsers

Summary Steps :

npm init
npm install -D parcel
npm install react
npm install react-dom
npx parcel index.html or npx parcel build index.html
import React from 'react'; in App.js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; in App.js
use type="module" for index.html
Remove main : app.js from package.json
Write browserslist in package.json
"browsersList" : [ "last 2 versions"]

Config - driven UI : Different UI layout for different users - Backend driven config

Optional chaining ?

Props (Properties) -> attributes passed through component tag -> similar to arguments passed in function in js -> received as parameters in the function (component in react)

: const Component = (props)=>{()} :: func(arguments) : const func = (parameters) => {}

Virtual DOM -> representation/copy of DOM with us

Purpose : React Reconciliation -> React uses diff Algorithm to diff one tree (actually dom) from another which determines what needs to be updated and only re-renders the diff

re-render everything if key is not mentioned
